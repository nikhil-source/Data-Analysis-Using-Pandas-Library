The dataset consists of measurements of fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contraction (UC) features 
on cardiotocograms classified by expert obstetricians

Attribute Information:
LB - FHR baseline (beats per minute)
AC - # of accelerations per second
FM - # of fetal movements per second
UC - # of uterine contractions per second
DL - # of light decelerations per second
DS - # of severe decelerations per second
DP - # of prolongued decelerations per second
ASTV - percentage of time with abnormal short term variability
MSTV - mean value of short term variability
ALTV - percentage of time with abnormal long term variability
MLTV - mean value of long term variability
Width - width of FHR histogram
Min - minimum of FHR histogram
Max - Maximum of FHR histogram
Nmax - # of histogram peaks
Nzeros - # of histogram zeros
Mode - histogram modeMean - histogram mean
Median - histogram medianVariance - histogram varianceTendency - histogram tendency
CLASS - FHR pattern class code (1 to 10) 
NSP - fetal state class code (N=normal; 
S=suspect; P=pathologic)

Model:
This is an classification problem . Using Random Forest we are trying to find the Fetal state class code.
(N=normal; S=suspect; P=pathologic).
Achieved Accuracy: 95.3%
